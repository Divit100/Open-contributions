# ***Natural Language Processing***

* *Tokenizers*
* *Padding*
* *Word Embeddings*
* *Pooling Layers such as:*
  * *Conv1D*
  * *GRU (Gated Recurrent Units)*
  * *HTML(Long Short Term Memory)*
* *Sentiment Analysis (Movie Review,Sarcasm Detection)*
* *Text Prediction*


### ***All these were implemented using the Tensorflow library(Python 3.0) and also  Deep Neural Networks(Deep Learning) ***
